# Workflow: Issues, Branch, PR

**Never make changes or commits directly on `main`.**

For every bug or feature:

1. **Document in GitHub**  
   Create or reference an issue in the project’s GitHub repo (bug report or feature request).

2. **Create a branch**  
   From `main` (or `develop` if the project uses Git Flow):  
   `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `fix/*`, or `release/vX.Y.Z` as appropriate.

3. **Implement and test**  
   Do all edits and commits on that branch. Run the test suite (`uv run pytest`) and fix any failures.

4. **Push and open a PR**  
   Push the branch and open a Pull Request targeting `main` (or `develop`).  
   Link the PR to the issue (e.g. “Fixes #123”).

5. **Merge after review**  
   Do not merge yourself unless the project allows it; wait for review/approval if required.

For hotfixes or release bumps, use a dedicated branch (e.g. `fix/description` or `release/0.9.1`) and follow the same flow.
